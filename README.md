# CSGO Cheat

This cheat is an **internal** cheat, meaning it gets injected into the running process (in this case, csgo.exe). 

To use it, get the project, **open up CSGO first**, and then run the solution. One window should appear, from the Visual Studio process.
But then you should get a second console window that spawns from the CSGO process itself. This is the window you should look at.

Press F1 to toggle **Spray Control**, which removes spray entirely
Press F2 to toggle **Bunny Hopping**, which is a way in CSGO to move really fast
Press F3 to **exit the cheat** (i.e, uninject the DLL)
Press F4 to enable the **triggerbot**, which instantly shoots for you when you hover over a player's head
Press F5 to enable **aim assist**, which guides your cursor towards enemies when you hover near them.

Working to add more!
