# CSGO Cheat

This cheat is an **internal** cheat, meaning it (the DLL that is created) gets injected into the running process (in this case, csgo.exe). 

To use it, get the project, **open up CSGO first**, and then run the solution. One window should appear, from the Visual Studio process.
But then you should get *a second console window* that spawns from the CSGO process itself. This is the window you should look at.

- Press F1 to toggle **Spray Control**, which removes spray entirely

- Press F2 to toggle **Bunny Hopping**, which is a way in CSGO to move really fast

- Press F3 to **exit the cheat** (i.e, uninject the DLL)

- Press F4 to enable the **triggerbot**, which instantly shoots for you when you hover over a player's head

- Press F6 to enable **aim assist**, which guides your cursor towards enemies when you hover near them.

This was only possible due to the [leaked csgo source code](https://github.com/perilouswithadollarsign/cstrike15_src), and also this [wonderful tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xunnwiOwHvI&t=9s) (mainly the first 2 videos). 

Got more familiar with things like:

- IDA PRO 
- Cheat Engine
- x32dbg
- Sig Scan
- Hooking (CreateMove + ApplyMouse), still a noob at this tho
- Common Windows API functions
